There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

 # Recall.js

**Recall.js** uses spaced-repetition learning to help software engineers learn, practice, and remember technical interview questions.

## Summary
**Recall.js** will help keep your technical skills up-to-date and prepare you to take on a technical interview at a moment’s notice. It uses a spaced-repetition learning algorithm to optimize your recall of technical interview questions. In addition, its focus on TDD and in-browser coding provides a productive learning environment for evaluating your performance on programming challenges.

## Problem
Practicing technical interview questions is incredibly important when preparing for a software engineering interview. When an individual decides to look for another position, he/she must spend time preparing for such questions. Often times, this individual reviews coding challenges that they have practiced for prior interviews. Not only is this time wasted, but it reflects the degradation of engineering knowledge over time.

## Solution
**Recall.js** addresses this problem by providing software engineers a tool to use that will help them practice technical interview questions. By using spaced-repetition learning, combined with an in-browser console and associated tests, **Recall.js** will help limit the amount of time wasted in reviewing already seen material.

In addition, **Recall.js** provides a collaborative community in which the user can discover new and interesting programming challenges, and share theirs with the world.
